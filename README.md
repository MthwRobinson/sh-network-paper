Abstract: In recent years, researchers have argued that crowd sourcing generates better requirements by eliciting feedback from a broader range of stakeholders. Proposed benefits of crowd-based requirements process include a higher volume of requirements reflecting a broader array of use cases and a more engaged and committed user base. Researchers cite the inability of project teams to effectively manage an overwhelming volume of crowd-sourced system requirements as a possible drawback. Using a data set consisting of project management artifacts from 562 open source software projects, this paper uses generalized linear models to analyze how system performance varies as the percentage of requirements sourced from the crowd increases with respect to five measures of effectiveness: the average requirement close-out and response times, the average comment activity on requirements, the average number of issues per crowd member, and the average volume of requirements over time. Additionally, the models measure how the impact of additional crowd engagement changes with stakeholder network structure. For each measure of effectiveness except issues per crowd member, the analysis shows that the effect of increasing crowd engagement changes depending on the structure of the stakeholder network and the percentage of requirements sourced from the crowd. The results imply stakeholder networks with multiple, disjoint hubs and a low level of localized clustering absorb additional crowd engagement most effectively and suggest that systems engineers who seek to employ crowd-based requirements processes should encourage contributors to specialize and develop processes to route incoming requirements to the appropriate specialist.
